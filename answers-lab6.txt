1.How did you structure your transmit implementation? In particular, what do you do if the transmit ring is full?

	As the document says, I use data structures like transmit descriptor array and packet buffer. If the transmit ring gets full, I will simply return -1 as a signal of error and let the upper layer deal with it.
 
2.How did you structure your receive implementation? In particular, what do you do if the receive queue is empty and a user environment requests the next incoming packet?

	Almost the same way as I choose in question one.

3.What does the web page served by JOS's web server say?

	It says “This file came from JOS.” and “Cheesy web page!”.


4.How long approximately did it take you to do this lab?

	Maybe three days, most of my time is spent on the manul reading.

Challenge

	I choose the first challenge, as the manual says, I read the real MAC address from  EEPROM.
